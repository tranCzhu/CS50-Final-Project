Hi!
<br>
<br>
Welcome to Trancy Zhu's CS50 Final Project - "Rate Your Experiences!"
<br>
<br>
"Rate Your Experiences" is a website that allows users to search up for a summer/winter/internship program in a database, look at past reviews about the specific program, and write their own reviews about the program.
<br>
<br>
When you arrive at the homepage of this website, you can start by typing in a key word associated with the title of the program that you're looking for. For example, if you want to check out programs affiliated with Harvard, you can enter "Harvard" into the blank above the search button. If you don't enter anything, you will receive an alert from the website where you'll be asked to enter a key word. Once you click the "search" button, you will be directed to a results page in which all programs that contain the entered key word in their titles will be displayed in a list format. You can find the program that you want and enter the program page by clicking the title of the program.
<br>
<br>
The program page is where you can see basic information such as title, affiliation, time duration, and description of the program. Most importantly, it is also where you can see the past rating and reviews about the program. The "Average Rating" below the program title reflects an average of all ratings submitted by past users, if no user has rated/reviewed this program, the program will have a "None" for rating; all ratings are out of 5. You can also follow the link next to "Program Website" to check out the details about the program. Below all the program information is where you can see past reviews about the program. Those past reviews contain a left-aligned title, center-aligned review content, the reviewer's nickname, and the rating that the reviewer gives to the program. You can also submit your own rating and review for the program right below the past reviews. You can fill out the blanks with your nickname, rating for the program, title of the review, and review content; please don't leave any field blank as the website won't let you submit a review with any blank field, nor does it accept a rating out of the range of 0 to 5. Once you hit the submit button, you will be redirected back to the same program page and you will now see your review on the bottom of all the past reviews. The average rating of the program on the top of the page may also increase or drop because of your rating.
<br>
<br>
By clicking the title of the website ("Rate & Review Your Experiences in Internship/Summer/Winter Programs!"), you can go back to the home page and restart your search. If a program that you want to find is not in the database, you can register the program into the database. Simply go to the search results page and scroll to the botton where it says "register your program... HERE," click the "HERE" and you will be directed to the program registration page. In the registration page you will be asked to enter the basic information about the program (program title, affiliation, time duration, etc.) and you must complete all blanks to register this program. Once you have successfully register a program, a unique id is assigned to the new program and you will be redirected to the program page where the information that you just entered will be displayed, along with input boxes where you can submit review for it, exactly like other programs' pages. The rating of the program will start with a "None," but once there are user ratings, the overall rating will be updated to the average of all user ratings.

This is all about my website, hope you enjoy playing around with it!
